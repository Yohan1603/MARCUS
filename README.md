# MARCUS – AI-Based Personal Assistant

## Overview
MARCUS is a Python-based AI personal assistant designed to perform basic system tasks using voice commands and automation.  
The goal of this project was to understand how an AI assistant works internally, including voice input handling, command processing, and task execution.

This project focuses on logic building and practical implementation rather than just theoretical concepts.

---

## Objectives
- To build a functional AI assistant using Python
- To understand voice recognition and command parsing
- To automate basic system-level tasks
- To gain hands-on experience with AI-assisted development

---

## Features
- Voice command recognition
- Executes basic system commands
- Python-based modular structure
- Extensible for future AI integrations

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Speech Recognition Libraries
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- AI APIs (used for guidance and enhancement)

---

## How It Works
1. The assistant listens for user voice input.
2. The input is converted into text using speech recognition.
3. Commands are processed using conditional logic.
4. Relevant actions or responses are executed by the system.
5. Output is given back through voice or terminal response.

## AI Usage Disclosure
AI tools were used for guidance, debugging, and understanding best practices.  
All core logic, structure, and implementation decisions were done by me, and I am able to explain every part of the project.

---

## Challenges Faced
- Handling voice recognition accuracy
- Managing command execution safely
- Structuring the project for scalability

---

## Future Improvements
- Add authentication for personal use
- Improve command accuracy
- Integrate advanced NLP models
- Add GUI interface
